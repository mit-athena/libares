Major changes in release 1.1.0:
* Added ares_free_string() function so that memory can be freed in the
  same layer as it is allocated, a desirable feature in some
  environments.
* A few of the ares_dns.h macros are fixed to use the proper bitwise
  operator.
* Fixed a couple of fenceposts fixed in ares_expand_name()'s
  bounds-checking.
* In process_timeouts(), extract query->next before calling
  next_server() and possibly freeing the query structure.
* Casted arguments to ctype macros casted to unsigned char, since not
  all char values are valid inputs to those macros according to ANSI.
