.SH NAME
ares_process \- Process events for name resolution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ares.h>
.PP
.B void ares_process(ares_channel \fIchannel\fP, fd_set *\fIread_fds\fP,
.B	fd_set *\fIwrite_fds\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_process
function handles input/output events and timeouts associated with
queries pending on the name service channel identified by
.IR channel .
The file descriptor sets pointed to by
.I read_fds
and
.I write_fds
should have file descriptors set in them according to whether the file
descriptors specified by
.BR ares_fds (3)
are ready for reading and writing.  (The easiest way to determine this
information is to invoke
.B select
with a timeout no greater than the timeout given by
.BR ares_timeout (3)).
.PP
The
.B ares_process
function will invoke callbacks for pending queries if they complete
successfully or fail.
